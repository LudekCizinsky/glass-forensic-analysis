\section{Introduction}
Glass is a material that is prominently part of criminal investigation processes. When a suspect is apprehended for a crime involving shattered glass, it is a standard procedure to submit particles of his clothing to a forensic science laboratory, in order to determine whether or not evidentiary material is present. However, even in the case where glass particles were detected, it often remains unclear whether those particles are connected to the crime. On this basis, the goal of this project was to build a machine learning model, that is able to classify different types of glass fragments based on their elemental composition and refractive index (RI). 

% we could add something along the lines:
% the goal of this paper is to report the main findings % project, and has this and this section. but not really necessary i feel

% The goal of this report is to examine different classification methods for the purpose of classifying different type of glass. In the report, we first describe given data-set. We then proceed to the introduction of selected classification methods and description of their implementation. Finally, we conclude the report by discussing performance of the chosen classification methods.
